# PieTheNiceGuys-Deprecated-E2-Repository
This folder represents over 2200+ hours worth of time learning, practicing, and creating Expression 2 Scripts.

After a couple of years of not playing GarrysMod, or working on GarrysMod Content, I have decided to upload my full folder of Expression 2 scripts. I stopped keeping them up to date in 2019, so please do not message me regarding something being broken. I am mainly uploading this for educational purposes.

I do not believe this folder should be used to represent me as a programmer. I am just trying to provide a place for new programmers to learn and discover the different possibilites of the language.

If I had to pick one of my favorite files, and maybe my best E2, I would choose the e2 I did as a custom gig (that I was never paid for) dynamic_egp_gunshop.txt
It fully automated darkRP's dealer classes and provided a screen for anyone to purchase items. 

Please make a pull request if you notice any non PC language. I have moved past the point in my life and would like to just remove it completely.
